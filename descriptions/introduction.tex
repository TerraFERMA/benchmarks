\chapter{Introduction} \label{sec:app}

In this supplemental material we provide the results of several well known benchmarks using \TF{}.  For each case we provide a brief description of the benchmark and the convergence results produced using \TF{} as compared to published solutions, where available.  When the non-dimensionalization used in the residual differs from that in the literature our results have been rescaled for comparison. Descriptions of each of the benchmark values listed in the tables can be found in the original papers.   Complete and reproducible \texttt{tfml} files and meshes for  the benchmarks can be found as a separate git repository at \url{bitbucket.org/tferma/benchmarks}.
