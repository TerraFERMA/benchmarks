\chapter{Incompressible Three-Dimensional Convection: \citeauthor{Busse1993}} \label{sec:busse}

\citet{Busse1993} described several benchmarks for
incompressible convection in a three-dimensional domain of unit height
and aspect ratio in the horizontal dimensions of $a$ and $b$.  The prognostic variables are velocity, $\vec{v}$,
pressure $p$, and temperature, $T$.

For the steady-state cases considered (1a and 2) boundary conditions for temperature are $T=0$ at the top surface, $z=1$, $T=1$ at the base, $z=0$,
with insulating (homogeneous Neumann, $\nabla T\cdot\vec{n} = 0$) side-walls.  For velocity the top surface and base have no-slip
boundary conditions applied while all vertical sides impose free-slip conditions.
Simulations are run using full time-dependence on a coarse mesh until the solution reaches an approximate steady state.  This
solution is then interpolated to a variety of higher resolutions and used as an initial guess to solve the true steady state
problem.

\paragraph{Case 1a}
Isoviscous steady-state cases are defined in a domain with aspect ratio, $a=1.0079$, $b=0.6283$,
with a Rayleigh number of $3\times10^4$ (Table \ref{tab:busse1a}).

%\paragraph{Case 2}
%
%In the variable viscosity case, the
%viscosity is temperature dependent with 
%\begin{equation}
% \mu = \exp\left[Q/(T+G) - Q/(0.5+G)\right]
%\end{equation}
%where
%\begin{gather}
%Q = [255/\log{r}] - 0.25\log{r} \\
%G = [15/\log{r}] - 0.5
%\end{gather}
%with $r = \eta(T=0)/\eta(T=1) = 20$.
%Convergence results are given in Table \ref{tab:busse2} for
%$\Ra=2\times10^4$, aspect ratio $a=b=1$.
